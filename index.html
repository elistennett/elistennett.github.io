        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Elijah Joseph Stennett, but I've always used the nickname "Eli." I was born and raised in San Luis
            Obispo, and I have lived in Arroyo Grande for the past 15 years. I attended Arroyo Grande High School, where
            I graduated in 2017. I chose not to apply to any Univerities or State Colleges, because Cuesta College was a the only affordable option (FREE!). Business was my declared major at Cuesta, and after my first year I had enjoyed it, but I was looking for something more specific and fitting to my skill set.</p>

        <h1>Why Fullstack?</h1>
        <p>When I first found out about Fullstack @ SLO, I immediately took interest in the opportunity and embarked on the journey along with my cousin Conner. The part that stood out to me was the idea that anyone can start learning
            to code. Coding was always something that interested me, as I have loved computers, and technology as a whole for as long as I can remember. However, I never had this significant of an opportunity to try it out. On July 16th of 2018, I entered my first day of class at CodeSLO. I instantly fell in love with code, and I found myself coding in my free time. It has been a newfound skill that I thoroughly enjoy. When I heard that Fullstack @ SLO was seeking to place students into local jobs, I was thrilled because of my desire to find a career in the area. I adore SLO county and hope to stay local.</p>

        <h1>SLO County Roots</h1>
        <p>My SLO County Roots go back five generations, and possibly even more. I have over 30 family members in the county including 7 cousins who are like siblings to me. Not to mention all of the lifelong friends that I have grown up with. I am deeply rooted to San Luis Obispo County and I am here to stay. As you will see in the video, this opportunity means very much to me. I am very thankful to be considered for a scholarship that will send me down a path to an exciting career that I cannot wait to experience.</p></div>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Discovering coding has opened my eyes to a journey in life that I had never imagined before. Two months ago, if you had asked me to create a website like this from scratch, I would have had no idea where to start. Now I can code many projects with ease and have a great time doing it. Leadership is an attribute that I am proud to carry, and I had a great time using this skill in the CodeSLO Hackathon as a team leader. I look forward to using my communication and leadership skills in my journey through Fullstack Academy. I take interest in so many of the local companies that seek software engineers, and I would be delighted to work for one of them. Coding is a natural fit for me and I am determined to have a career that flourishes and keeps me in this wonderful place I call home.</p>
